# AML Kaggle Competition — README

## Project
Small repository for building a translator model (MLP) as part of the final AML Kaggle submission. The repository focuses on reproducible data preparation and a compact MLP-based translator implementation.

## Key points
- `translator_final.ipynb` — implementation of the translator (an MLP-based model). This file contains the code to build, train and run the translator.
- `aml_competition_report.pdf` — report of the project, including methodology, experiments, and results.
- `development_notebook_v1.ipynb` - notebook, where we tested different architectures for the translation function. (not used for final submission).
- `development_notebook_v2.ipynb` - notebook, where we tested different architectures for the translator model. (not used for final submission).
