# AML Kaggle Competition — README

## Project
Small repository for building a translator model (MLP) as part of the final AML Kaggle submission. The repository focuses on reproducible data preparation and a compact MLP-based translator implementation.

## Key points
- `data_prep_for_final_model/` — essential data-preparation code and scripts (cleaning, feature engineering, train/val/test splits).
- `my_translator_v2.py` — implementation of the translator (an MLP-based model). This file contains the code to build, train and run the translator.
